Didn't notice the dashed vertical lines in the histogram that require geom_abline()

Color vs Fill aes

Lots of folks added coord_flip() which is fine, but then you would need to swap the x and y axis for the mtcars boxplots

On the coding section, running into the problem of copus.1 copus.2... etc. Find solutions to avoid this if you can.

Continuing the pipe onto the plot; separate these. For example,

copus1 <- copus %>%
  filter(!is.na(Size))

 ggplot(copus1, aes(x = Size)) +
    geom_bar()

dpi doesn't mean anything for a vector file specified in inches
