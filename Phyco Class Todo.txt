Phyco Class Todo:

1. Cleaning:
 - Treatment, Phycocyanin (AB), Enclosure, Interval, Temp, Secchi (cm), DO (mg/L)
 - Rename: 
  - Interval = Day
  - Enclosure = ID
  - Phycocyanin (ug/L) = PC 
  - Secchi (cm) = Secchi
  - Treatment = Tx
  - DO (mg/L) = DO
 - Within ID, "Community-1" change it to a number 1
 - Get rid of any "Pond" data
 - Time: turn to numeric days
 - Turn PC back into numeric, replace "n/a" with NA
 - filter out 2hr (missing from what we need)
 
 2. Exploration
- Distributions: Phycocyanin, Secchi, verify the logical pieces
  - histograms Phyco
  
 - Relationships
 - avgs & std's()
  - Days(x) Phyco (y) Treatment (color)
  - Days(x) Phyco (y) Treatment (facetted)
  - Secci (x) Phyco(y) Treatmetn (color)
  - correlations pairwise 

- add TN (total nitrogen)


3. Analysis:
- Baseline model PC ~ 1
- RM ANOVA: PC ~ Treatment + |Day
  - Posthocs comparisons NO3 - C NH4 - C Urea - C + ...
- Ideally keep variability, but avoid crowdedness
