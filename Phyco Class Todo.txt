1. Cleaning:
 - Treatment, Phycocyanin (AB), Enclosure, Interval, Temp, Secchi (cm), DO (mg/L)

  - Enclosure = ID
  - Phycocyanin (ug/L) = PC 
  - Secchi (cm) = Secchi
  - Treatment = Tx
  - DO (mg/L) = DO
 - Within ID, "Community-1" change it to a number 1
 - Get rid of any "Pond" data
 - Time: turn to numeric days
 - Turn PC back into numeric, replace "n/a" with NA
 - filter out 2hr (missing from what we need)
